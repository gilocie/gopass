## Core Features:

- Organizer Registration & Dashboard: Event organizers can sign up, manage events, and view a dashboard showing upcoming/past events and ticket stats.
- Event Creation Form: Organizers can input event details (name, date, location, duration), define ticket categories (e.g., 'Conference Only', 'Conference + Lunch'), upload event branding, and custom ticket templates.
- Attendee CSV Upload: CSV upload for attendee data (name, email, ticket type, benefits). The system auto-generates unique tickets with a QR code and assigned benefits. There is an option to manually add/edit attendees too.
- Ticket Security & PIN Access: Each ticket is PIN-protected and can only be viewed after login and PIN input. Downloading is disabled; tickets viewable inside platform only (unless organizer chooses otherwise).
- QR Code Ticket Verification: Staff can scan QR codes using a built-in scanner to view attendee info and benefits. Staff can mark benefits as used, and the system tracks which days/benefits are used. Each scan logs usage time and staff name.
- Benefit Tracking: The system tracks usage of benefits per user per day, and remaining benefits are visible to staff and organizers.
- Downloadable Reports: Event organizers can download attendance logs and usage reports by benefit.
- Ticket Designer: Ticket designer platform that will pull event details dynamically to the ticket and allow user just to add Ticket holder's full name, his passport photo size, email where ticket will be share, and his auto generated 6 digits pin that user will type in to verify his ticket to allow manager to manage it by marking benefits to un usable.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant purple (#9D4EDD) to convey innovation and exclusivity.
- Background color: A light purple (#F5EEFE) to complement the primary color, maintaining a professional and elegant feel.
- Accent color: A complementary pink (#EE4266) to highlight key actions and call-to-action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, modern, and easily readable user interface.
- Use a set of minimalist and consistent icons to represent different event types and functionalities. Use purple as a fill-color for the icons.
- Employ a clean and structured layout, ensuring that all information is easily accessible and digestible. Prioritize the most important features on each page, minimizing clutter.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement. For instance, a smooth fade-in effect on content loading and a simple animation for successful ticket verification.
